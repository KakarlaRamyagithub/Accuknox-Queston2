"""
This script uses the requests library to send HTTP GET requests to the specified URL. Here's how it works:
The check_application_status() function takes the URL of the application as input.
It sends an HTTP GET request to the URL.
If the response status code is 200 (OK), it returns 'up', indicating that the application is functioning correctly.
If the response status code is not 200 or if an exception occurs during the request, it returns 'down', indicating that the application is unavailable or not responding.
The main() function calls check_application_status() with the URL of the application and prints the status to the console.
You can customize the url variable to point to the URL of your application. The script will accurately assess the application's status based on the HTTP status codes it receives.
